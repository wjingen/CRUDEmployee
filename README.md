# Employee Registration System

Fully functional Employee Registration System (ERS) with Create, Read, Update and Delete Operations. Supports entering up to four fields (Name, Email, Position and Status). Database uses Cloud Firestore and found in `firebase.js`.

This simple project was my way of delving into the inner workings of VueJS and Google Firebase. I learnt about reactivity, emit events and state handling within VueJS, as well as storing confidential information with Firebase.

VueJS libraries used include Vuetify, Material Design.
